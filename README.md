# My-Map-Reduce
Implemented a map reduce coordinator(or master, as called in original paper). This is part of the fifth homework of UCB CS162.

Detailed usage is described in https://cs162.org/static/hw/hw-map-reduce/docs/background/development/.

The code I've written is put under folder My-Map-Reduce/coordinator, other codes are provided by UCB.
